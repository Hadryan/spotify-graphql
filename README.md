# Spotify GraphQL

This is a fully documented GraphQL API wrapper on top of the Spotify API. It exposes nearly all public API methods that do not require user authentication. The only missing feature is the ability to [Get Recommendations](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/browse/get-recommendations/).
